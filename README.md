**Want to contribute to open source projects but don't know where to start?**

Open source is the way to go. Whenever a new project is started, one should always consider if there is an interesting open source project out there that solves your issue. I have experienced incredible efforts in the field and was aiming to contribute myself as well. However, where do you start? There are so many projects to contribute to and it is difficult to find where to begin. This is where this project comes in.

- **GitHub repository**: <https://github.com/mikeweltevrede/contribute-to-open-source/>
- **Documentation** <https://github.com/mikeweltevrede/contribute-to-open-source/>

# Goal
My goal is to build a tool that can help people navigate GitHub issues to find items that they can contribute to. Most people recommend starting with a tool that you use yourself, because you are familiar with its goals and that is a great place to start. However, those projects might also be very daunting to work with. Some open source projects that are established might be very complex in the background and are not a good place to begin your open source journey. You first want to get familiar with the way of working by doing some relatively easy issues.

Want to help me in this journey? Thanks! Please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.rst](CONTRIBUTING.rst)!
